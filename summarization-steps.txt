Content Summarization Process
Tokenizing Content into Sentences using the TextPreprocessor Class:

Purpose: To break down the extracted text content into individual sentences for further processing.
Implementation: The TextPreprocessor class uses models from the OpenNLP library to tokenize the text.
Steps:
Load the sentence model (e.g., opennlp-en-ud-ewt-sentence-1.2-2.5.0.bin).
Use the model to split the text into sentences.
Example:
Java
// Initialize the TextPreprocessor with paths to sentence and tokenizer models
TextPreprocessor preprocessor = new TextPreprocessor(sentenceModelPath, tokenizerModelPath);

// Tokenize the content into sentences
String[] sentences = preprocessor.tokenizeSentences(fileContent);
Ranking Sentences Using the TextRank Class:

Purpose: To determine the importance of each sentence in the text, so that the most important sentences can be included in the summary.
Implementation: The TextRank algorithm ranks sentences based on their relevance and connectivity with other sentences.
Steps:
Create a graph where nodes represent sentences.
Connect nodes with edges based on sentence similarity.
Apply the TextRank algorithm to rank sentences.
Example:
Java
// Initialize the TextRank algorithm
TextRank textRank = new TextRank();

// Rank the sentences
List<String> rankedSentences = textRank.rankSentences(Arrays.asList(sentences));
Generating the Summary by Selecting Top-Ranked Sentences:

Purpose: To create a concise summary by selecting the most important sentences, while ensuring the total word count does not exceed the specified limit.
Implementation: Select sentences in order of their rank until the word count limit is reached.
Steps:
Initialize a counter for the total word count.
Iterate through the ranked sentences, adding them to the summary until the word count limit is reached.
Example:
Java
private String generateSummaryWithWordCount(List<String> sentences, int wordCount) {
    StringBuilder summary = new StringBuilder();
    int currentWordCount = 0;

    for (String sentence : sentences) {
        int sentenceWordCount = sentence.split("\\s+").length;
        if (currentWordCount + sentenceWordCount <= wordCount) {
            summary.append(sentence).append(" ");
            currentWordCount += sentenceWordCount;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    return summary.toString().trim();
}
Detailed Example
Combining all the steps, hereâ€™s how the summarization is achieved in the UploadServlet:

Java
private String processAndSummarizeContent(String fileContent, int wordCount) throws IOException {
    // Paths to sentence and tokenizer models
    String sentenceModelPath = "path/to/opennlp-en-ud-ewt-sentence-1.2-2.5.0.bin";
    String tokenizerModelPath = "path/to/opennlp-en-ud-ewt-tokens-1.2-2.5.0.bin";

    // Initialize the TextPreprocessor
    TextPreprocessor preprocessor = new TextPreprocessor(sentenceModelPath, tokenizerModelPath);

    // Tokenize the content into sentences
    String[] sentences = preprocessor.tokenizeSentences(fileContent);

    // Initialize the TextRank algorithm
    TextRank textRank = new TextRank();

    // Rank the sentences
    List<String> rankedSentences = textRank.rankSentences(Arrays.asList(sentences));

    // Generate the summary with a word count limit
    String summary = generateSummaryWithWordCount(rankedSentences, wordCount);
    return summary;
}
Summary Explanation
Tokenizing Content:

The TextPreprocessor class is used to split the raw text content into individual sentences.
This is achieved using pre-trained models from the OpenNLP library.
Ranking Sentences:

The TextRank class is used to rank the sentences based on their importance.
Sentences are represented as nodes in a graph, with edges indicating similarity between sentences.
The TextRank algorithm is applied to score each sentence.
Generating the Summary:

The top-ranked sentences are selected to form the summary.
The total word count of the summary is kept within the specified limit by adding sentences until the limit is reached.
